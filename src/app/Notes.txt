spyOn() doesn't allows actual function to run, instead it just tracks if that function has been called or not.

spyOn().and.callThrough() calls actual/original function

createSpyObj() creates a mock service of that service which we intent to test.Hence actual service is not called. We don't need spyOn() now as it will take care of it.

pipes ke sath .transfrom() use hota hai
expect(pipe.transform(30)).toEqual('30(strongest)');
